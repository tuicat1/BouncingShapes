# Bouncing Shapes Java Program with Nested Shapes, JTrees, JFrames, Event Listeners, and GUI

![Bouncing Shapes](bouncing_shapes_screenshot.png)

This Java program demonstrates a graphical application that features bouncing shapes within a JFrame. The shapes are not limited to simple circles or squares; they can be nested, providing a visually appealing and interactive experience. In addition to the bouncing shapes, the program includes a JTree to manage the shape hierarchy, event listeners to handle user interactions, and a GUI for controlling the animation.

## Features

- **Bouncing Shapes:** A set of shapes (e.g., circles and rectangles) will move around the screen, bouncing off the edges.

- **Nested Shapes:** Shapes can be nested within one another, creating more complex patterns.

- **JTrees:** A JTree component displays the shape hierarchy, allowing users to add, remove, and rearrange shapes.

- **JFrames:** The main application is displayed within a JFrame, providing a window to interact with the program.

- **Event Listeners:** Event listeners are used to handle user interactions, such as adding or removing shapes, pausing the animation, and more.

- **GUI:** A graphical user interface allows users to control the animation, pause/resume, add shapes, adjust animation speed, and more.
